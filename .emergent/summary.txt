The AI engineer successfully built a Transport Emission Calculator (later named CarbonRoute) from scratch, fulfilling comprehensive user requirements. Initially, the core application was developed, integrating various distance calculation APIs (Google Maps, , Haversine for airports) and implementing multimodal transport and cost tracking. An admin panel for emission factors was also created. The engineer iteratively improved the UI/UX, transitioning from an initial functional design to a dark theme, and finally to a professional light theme with transparency effects as requested. A significant addition was the integration of an AI optimization agent using the Emergent Universal Key and LiteLLM to provide suggestions for reducing emissions and costs. The process involved fixing multiple bugs, including search bar functionality, dropdown visibility, and dashboard chart display, demonstrating robust debugging and problem-solving.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is to build a Transport Emission Calculator (later branded CarbonRoute) to calculate scope 3 upstream and downstream transport emissions and logistics costs. Users should be able to:
1.  Enter goods type and quantity, with an option to add multiple goods.
2.  Specify from and to locations for each transport leg.
3.  Select transport mode: Road, Rail, Air, Water.
4.  Enter vehicle type.
5.  Input the cost of logistics for each leg (total or per unit).
6.  Utilize an Add transportation leg button for multimodal transport, repeating location, mode, vehicle, and cost details.
7.  View a dashboard displaying total emissions and total cost, categorized by goods.
Distance Calculation:
    -   **Roadway**: Google Maps Distance Matrix API.
    -   **Railway**: Google Maps Transit mode for trains, with a fallback to Haversine + 25% multiplier if API fails.
    -   **Seaway**:  Python library, using Google Maps for port coordinates.
    -   **Airways**: Haversine formula using a provided JSON database of airport coordinates, with a search bar for airports.
    -   Manual distance entry option for all modes.
Emission Factors:
    -   An admin panel should allow editing vehicle types and emission factors (fetched from India-based GHG protocol initially).
Dashboard & UI/UX:
    -   Initial UI should be functional and aesthetically pleasing.
    -   Display calculated distance and emissions on the calculation page.
    -   Include a reset option.
    -   Dashboard should show goods vs. cost graphs.
    -   Save and reuse frequently transported goods (later changed to number of trips).
    -   Improve UI response speed.
    -   Change the entire calculator theme to a light mode with suitable darker text and transparency effects, maintaining professionalism.
AI Integration:
    -   Integrate an AI agent to analyze final results and suggest changes, best alternatives (via web search), and ways to reduce emissions or costs, leveraging LLMs like OpenAI/Gemini/Claude using the Emergent Universal Key.

<pending_tasks>
-   User's initial request for Railway: Try to use same google map api but, when user clicks transport mode as railway, customise the search bar to search only railway stations from and two. While a fallback mechanism is in place, specifically customizing the search bar for railway stations was not explicitly confirmed as implemented.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer has successfully built and refined the CarbonRoute Transport Emission Calculator. The application now features a professional light theme with transparency effects, calculating emissions and costs for multimodal transport. It integrates Google Maps for road/rail distance,  for sea, and Haversine for air. A key feature is the AI optimization agent, powered by OpenAI GPT-4o via Emergent Universal Key, providing suggestions to reduce emissions and costs.

Most recently, the engineer addressed the user's request to simplify the dashboard. This involved removing the Total Distance card and adjusting the grid layout to  to prominently display Total Shipments, Total Cost, and Total Emissions cards. The dashboard charts (bar and pie) are functioning correctly, and all text is clearly visible in the light theme. The calculation results are displayed directly on the input page, which also has a working reset button. The dynamic search for locations for all transport modes is now fully functional, showing suggestions in a dropdown.

<optional_next_step>
The last explicit request from the user (removing total distance alone from the dashboard) has been completed. The next step is to wait for further instructions from the user.
