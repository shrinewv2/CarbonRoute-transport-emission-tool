# Recent Changes to Transport Emission Tool

## Scatter Plot Improvements âœ¨

### What Changed:

Updated the scatter plot in the Dashboard to provide better visualization of emission data across different GHG categories.

**ðŸ”§ Bug Fix:** Fixed scatter plot to correctly categorize shipments based on the good's GHG category and display proper category names in tooltips.

**âœ¨ New Feature (Latest):** Added interactive filter buttons to show/hide specific GHG categories in the scatter plot.

### Changes Made:

1. **Color-Coded GHG Categories**
   - **Upstream Transportation**: Blue (#3b82f6)
   - **Downstream Transportation**: Green (#10b981)
   - **Company Owned Transportation**: Purple (#8b5cf6)

2. **Dynamic Bubble Sizing**
   - Bubble size now represents the **quantity transported**
   - Larger bubbles = higher quantity
   - Smaller bubbles = lower quantity
   - Size scales proportionally based on weight (kg/tons)

3. **Enhanced Visual Clarity**
   - Semi-transparent bubbles with colored borders
   - Better distinction between different transport categories
   - Improved tooltip showing:
     - Good name
     - Emissions (kg COâ‚‚)
     - Cost (â‚¹)
     - Quantity (kg)
     - Category type

4. **Interactive Category Filters**
   - Three toggle buttons below the scatter plot
   - Click to show/hide specific categories:
     - **Blue button**: Toggle Upstream data
     - **Green button**: Toggle Downstream data
     - **Purple button**: Toggle Company Owned data
   - All categories enabled by default
   - Instantly filters visible data points
   - Active buttons show with colored background
   - Inactive buttons show grayed out

### How It Looks:

The scatter plot now displays:
- **X-axis**: COâ‚‚ Emissions (kg)
- **Y-axis**: Cost (â‚¹)
- **Bubble Size**: Quantity transported
- **Bubble Color**: GHG Category (Upstream/Downstream/Company Owned)

### Benefits:

âœ… Easier to identify which category contributes most to emissions
âœ… Visual correlation between quantity, cost, and emissions
âœ… Quick comparison across different transport types
âœ… Better data-driven decision making

### Location:

Dashboard Tab â†’ "Transport Emissions & Cost Analysis" section
